Cross-platform builds of `mips` binutils.

You must wonder "Why don't you just use the package from apt??" The answer to this is: some distros don't use apt at all (like Arch Linux) and there's no trusted source to get this binary, and distrobox isn't great for make builds in my experience, so I did this in an attempt to make this better. (PS: I don't trust AUR.)

I use Arch btw.
